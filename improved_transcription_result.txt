♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ "Did you expect me to speak? I've only one speech to give, and it is the same one I would deliver whether we stood on the cusp of a battlefield, or happened upon one another on a city street. I've always held onto a singular hope, to unite this kingdom under one English crown. ♪♪ Every man is born with the certitude of death. It's an inevitable truth that follows us through life. If today becomes your day of reckail, so be it. If it is mine, then I accept that. Perhaps today is mine and tomorrow is yours. Regardless, what truly matters is that you carry in your hearts the awareness that today you embody the unified kingdom. You are England. Each of you is a piece of England! England extends into the space between each of us. Don't fight for yourselves alone. Fight for this space! Occupy it! Transform it into something tangible! Make it invincible! Make it inherently yours! Make England manifest within it! Make England take form! ♪♪ Esteemed gentlemen, to your positions, captains, lords! Answer the call!
